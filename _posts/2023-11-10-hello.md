This is a space for me to share random thoughts.  Pardon the pun.  I expect the content will center around an eclectic mix of my interests - math, science, programming, music, and literature.

I'm still figuring out how to configure GitHub so I can enable a tenable workflow, particularly with respect to embedding math text via LaTeX or similar.  More will come as time allows
