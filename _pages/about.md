This is a blog that I'm using to collect various thoughts I have, and put them on display for other's amusement.  It'll feature a fair bit of math, science, programming, music, and literature.  

I am mostly writing because *I enjoy the act of writing* as its own activity.  Any additional value derived beyond my own enjoyment is icing, and will suit some tastes better than others.
